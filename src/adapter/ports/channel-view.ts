 *   `output` event — live output without the model polling; on kernels
 *   without the bus it falls back to mirroring the agent's own `job_output`
 *   tool results as they stream through the session event log
 *   ({@link BackgroundJobStore.onOutputSeen}).
 * - Jobs are process-local and owner-fenced. `list(agent)` returns exactly
