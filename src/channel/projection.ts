/**
 * The shared reducer (docs/agent-backend-design.md): Agent Domain events in,
 * `ChannelState` mutations out, for every backend and for durable replay and
 * the live stream alike. Decoding a backend's native events is not done here:
 * a translator (`src/dsh-adapter/backend/translate.ts` for DSH) produces the
 * `AgentEvent`s; this module only folds them.
 *
 * The DSH projection goldens (`scripts/fixtures/dsh/*.golden.json`) pin its
 * behaviour: attempt start/discard/revive, `seq` idempotency, legacy
 * overlapping-prefix delta merge, thinking preview/full folding, TPS
 * turn/step accounting, token/cost bucketing, compaction context reset,
 * goal/todo/preset/title/colour, question/subagent card suppression and the
 * plugin renderer seam. The order of wall-clock reads is part of that
 * contract (the goldens pin `startedAt`/`durationMs` with a stepping clock).
