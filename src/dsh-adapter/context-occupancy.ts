/**
 * Official context occupancy for the footer, the status commands and the
 * context-low warning.
 *
 * Occupancy answers "how full is the window", which is NOT the question the
 * provider usage of the last settled `assistant/message` answers. That sample
 * has two blind spots this module removes:
 *
 * 1. **It is a sample of a *past* request.** A rejected/overflowed request
 *    writes no `assistant/message`, so the sample stays small exactly when the
 *    provider says the prompt is too big.
 * 2. **It cannot see a compaction.** A checkpoint replaces the surface without
 *    reporting usage of its own.
 *
 * DSH's token meter already projects both away: `contextPressure.projectedTokens`
 * is the provider-anchored sample plus the signed surface movement since it was
 * taken, i.e. the occupancy of the NEXT request. The Web UI reads that value
 * through `ui-conversation`'s `contextOccupancy()`; this module reads the same
 * projection through the same legal seam `activity-store.ts` uses
 * (`ctx.inject(['sessionProjections'])` + the structural registry duck type +
 * a cleanup on the injected fiber).
 *
 * Two properties shape the transport here:
 *
 * 1. **The change feed carries the whole value.** `onChanged` hands one unit's
 *    schema-validated wire view (`session-projection/index.d.ts`), so this
 *    module never folds history to stay current — only the session BIND reads
 *    one snapshot, because a value that has not changed since it was published
 *    never arrives again and a resumed session would otherwise show nothing.
 * 2. **Absence is normal.** A bare `cordis.yml` composition has no dsh-base
 *    bundle and therefore no token meter; the projection key is simply not
 *    registered. The store stays empty and the channel falls back to the
 *    last-request sample it has always shown (see `resolveContextOccupancy`).
 * @module dsh-tui/dsh-adapter/context-occupancy
